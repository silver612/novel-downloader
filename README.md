# novel-downloader

To run, execute command: python <absolute path of scrape_v1.py>

1: Version 0: Contains a python program which scrapes data from a free novel site: https://www.lightnovelpub.com/browse .Involves the use of BeautifulSoup library in python.

2: Version 1: Shifted source from https://www.lightnovelpub.com/browse to https://vipnovel.com as original site now under protection from direct IP access.

3: Version 2: Added Python GUI using PySimpleGUI library.

4: Proposed future changes: Selection of chapters to download, use of some database to store record of all novels instead of scraping every time, sneak peak at chapter content. 

5: Flaws: Very long start-up (5 minutes) and response times, downloaded file of .txt type: not suitable for reading.
